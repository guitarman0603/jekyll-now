So after procastinating for more than a year, I have finally decided to start a blog. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/Images/coffee.jpg)

One of the most "difficult" decision for me was deciding what must I use to host my site. Why not WordPress, Drupal, Joomla or other
such available platforms. Well, apart from reading from different sources the advantages of github pages I was a bit biased towards 
Github. Apart from this, following https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now, made things ten folds easier, as you have everything ready for you by Barry Clark.
The main reason that I was inspired to start a blog regarding my musings is Andrej karpathy. NO! I have not delved much deep into
neural networks or Deep Learning YET! However, I have been following his blogs for quite a few months now, and the way he looks at things really entices me. The first article that I read by him was 'A survival guide to Ph.D.'. Again, NO, I am not pursuing one currently, but reading that article made me realize that one day I would love to.
Since I am interested in research related to Security and Machine Learning, I would like to use this blog as a platform to express
my opinions and research ideas that I come across in this field.
Feel free to get in touch with me, especially if we share the same interests( DAMN! We can talk for hours or maybe even days).
