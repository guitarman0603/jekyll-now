title: Acessories for Linux
---

Well, accessories can make you get noticed and make things rather fun. For different festivals we get dressed up differently with the myriad of clothes and well..”accessories” available. Isn’t that one of the most interesting part about festivals (perspective, really). So now, with my last set of chill vacations, I started having fun with Linux.

Being a noobie is tough as you have to face new challenges and not give on what we are trying to achieve. So, as an early start for Outreachy 2018 I am considering applying for THE LINUX KERNEL. 

However, mind can be ungovernable at times and does not focus on one particular thing. Side note: Those interested in doing the same can start with:  [The Linux Kernel](https://kernelnewbies.org/FirstKernelPatch). This is specifically Ubuntu/Debian based users. However, I am working on CentOS and its not that difficult as the instructions are pretty much the same with a few minor tweaks. So this is when I faced an issue that made me use tmux. While working on the patch for the kernel, I was using five different tabs for different things in my terminal. However, for making changes to the partition I had to reboot the system and though my chrome session was saved and retrieved, I was unable to retrive my terminal sessions and hence came across TMUX. Its a really cool application to multiplex different virtual consoles and the coolest part is, it saves those sessions and its really easy to use. The link to where I learnt to use it [tmux](https://www.vultr.com/docs/boost-productivity-with-tmux-on-ubuntu-and-centos).

If you are using an lxc container or docker or vagrant to work on some other distro like debian or fedora, this works pretty well there too. My base system is CentOS 7, however working for some specific applications I need to work on Debian and tmux can be really useful there. 

Another really interesting use is when we ssh into a PC, we can remote acess this session and continue to work on it from anywhere. Is it not cool?

Linux is fun!
