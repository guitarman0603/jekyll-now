title: Why a PhD?
---

You wake up one fine morning and end up contemplating, is this what I really want to do?

Well, this is how all it begins. The same old college life, but still different from my first two years of engineering. So just a brief, I am pursuing engineering from one of the decent engineering colleges in India.
 I had just entered my junior year and was losing weight at a drastic phase ( trust me, that IS a good thing as I weighed approximately around 265 pounds). I was studying my subjects day in day out to cover up for my previous mistakes ( MARKS WISE). So yeah I was well we can say evolving to become a fitter and a smarter person and I am sure it was not all that non-noticeable. However, what made me contemplate on the above question is, when an acquaintance came up to me just to ask me in a very dull tone - “ Are you happy?” my reply - “Well, I ought to be, why not?”. This is when I realized I am doing everything according to the norms of the society, am I really happy?  Yes I am a much fitter person now ( I had lost 89 pounds by then), so yes I am fit, but am I happy?
This is when I decided to look into a list of things I really and chalked down a list. My music, My cycling and of course my family and friends. But the biggest of them was the yearning to contribute to the society in some way, or maybe create something new. The easiest way was through technology. I realized that there are two sets of studies( it’s my perspective, nobody needs to get offended in any form) - one for marks and one for the love of the subject. Getting marks is like playing a game, where winning is getting a 9+ (on a scale of 10). But which game does not involve cheats? And this is how I felt. I was working and doing everything the way I was supposed to - what did that get me? -MARKS ( haha, yeah I did get a 9+ that semester) but my real knowledge was built during the vacations after my semester ended, when I interned in an amazing company and got hands on experience on one of my favorite topic that semester ( Operating systems). I remember reading and working every single day of those vacations, but after those vacations I could now answer the question that had been asked to me before- was I happy- YES! I felt I had done something good and achieved something ( and yes I continues to shed more pounds too xD).
Where is this getting me exactly? I knew I wanted to work on things hands on. I wanted to work under the able guidance of the Professors who could squeeze the best out of me. We all feel we are capable of so much more and that is most definitely true but mentorship is something that plays a drastic role in shaping a student’s brain. After my internships I yearned even more for such environment and sadly in my brain the concept of marks deteriorated even further. At Least from what I could observe happening in front of me. 
After a lot of unfortunate series of events however, I strongly believed that I want to work and do some good work under a Professor and this is how my journey began to the application process of PhD, where instead of searching for colleges I started a lookout for Professors working in the area that I particularly was intrigued by. And hence this is my story of why a PhD in US/Canada. In the hopeful search of like minded people.
