title: The chosen one- CentOS 7
---

Oh my god! Is it not a pain when you realize that there are endless number of choices out there for well...in my case Operating systems. 


Three years and five distros later, you realize there is an absolutely another world out there waiting to be explored. Sometimes, however, such things make you wonder, is choice really something you are looking for? The answer is always yes. Though, some might say otherwise. 

There are two ways of looking at it, if you go shopping for a washing machine or a refrigerator, more number of choices usually tend to confuse you. However, when we go out for clothes shopping, more the number of choices, better out fashion tends to become (hopefully, for most of the people). I consider an operating system like those clothes as we do need variety. I wonâ€™t wear a white one piece to a funeral, now would I? Similarly when we enter the world of embedded systems, I would NOT be using the same environment for every embedded system. It will depend on the application and the task that I am trying to perform in order to get the best output.

For the past six months I have been using Ubuntu 16.04 and 16.10 with GNOME desktop environment. I realized it was finally to move past the Debian family and to get cozy with a new family. This is when I decided to choose Red Hat and selected CentOS 7 to explore a bit. After having installed four different operating systems previously, I expected this transition to be smooth. However, life is not this simple especially when it comes to a crucial thing such as the operating system. Initially, I had chosen auto partitioning and it automatically ended up selecting LVM which gave me a major issue during boot time and despite trying to manually load the OS from the grub command line, I was facing issues. I hence had to wipe the partitions out again and install CentOS again. Also since I had downloaded a minimal iso image from the official site I had to download the desktop environment separately, however, that was not much of an issue. Just one command and bam I was all set to work on my new Operating system. 
All set to work with my new baby for at least the next six months. Hopefully it is NOT going to be a bumpy ride.
